# Voyages-Aeriens
## About
A Java command-line-based project about Air flight management coded by Mohamed Yassine Kharrat.
It was realised to mirror the client's requirement under the name appendix.txt. It focuses on the client's and air company's perspective. These two can view the details of scheduled flights but only the latter
can modify its data.
## project's constraints
Due to this being an assignment given by the uni to assess our capabilities and understanding of Oriented Object Programming, some features mentioned in the appendix didn't find their way into the final product, 
and some data structures such as collections were avoided despite being useful because our professor hadn't taught us them and insisted on using structures learnt in class. Databases were also avoided for the same
reason.
